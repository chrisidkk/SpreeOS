# SpreeOS
A lightweight, bloat-free version of Windows for the highest performance possible.

# Requirements
Make sure your device can support Windows 11.

At least 25GB of storage is needed.

At least a USB drive with 5GB is needed.

# What does it do?
SpreeOS gets rid of almost all the Windows and Microsoft bloat that comes in a regular Windows installation to improve performance so you can get the highest
possible frames in any game, or it can make things like rendering much smoother. You decide!

SpreeOS also disables trackers that Microsoft normally has running on Windows.

# Install

You can use this video as a guide to make your usb drive a bootable drive. You can also contact me on Discord for help! (chris.idk)
